# Clinical Disclaimer

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTICE

**This Clinical Case Similarity Detection System is NOT a medical device and is NOT intended for diagnostic purposes.**

---

## Intended Use

This system is designed as a **clinical decision SUPPORT tool** to help healthcare professionals identify historically similar clinical cases from published medical literature. It is intended for:

- **Educational purposes**: Learning from documented clinical cases
- **Research purposes**: Identifying patterns in rare disease presentations
- **Reference purposes**: Finding relevant case reports for clinical review
- **Support purposes**: Augmenting (not replacing) clinical judgment

---

## What This System Does NOT Do

❌ **Does NOT provide diagnoses**
- The system identifies similar cases, not diagnoses
- Similarity does not imply causation or identical conditions

❌ **Does NOT recommend treatments**
- Treatment decisions must be made by qualified clinicians
- Historical cases may not reflect current best practices

❌ **Does NOT replace clinical judgment**
- All output must be reviewed by qualified healthcare professionals
- Clinical context and patient-specific factors must be considered

❌ **Does NOT provide patient-specific advice**
- Output is based on published case reports, not individual patient data
- Each patient's situation is unique

## Limitations

### Data Limitations
- Based on published case reports which may have selection bias
- Does not include unpublished cases or negative findings
- May not reflect geographic or demographic variations
- Historical cases may not reflect current medical knowledge

### Technical Limitations
- Similarity scores are mathematical, not clinical assessments
- False positives and false negatives are possible
- Embedding-based similarity has inherent limitations
- System requires regular calibration and validation

### Clinical Limitations
- Similar presentations can have different underlying causes
- Rare diseases may have limited case representation
- Comorbidities and patient-specific factors are not fully captured
- Temporal evolution of conditions may not be represented
