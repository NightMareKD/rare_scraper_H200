# Checkpoints Directory

This directory contains checkpoint files for pipeline resumability.

## Files

- `scraped_urls.txt` - URLs already scraped (one per line)
- `normalized_ids.txt` - Case IDs that have been normalized
- `llm_reviewed_ids.txt` - Case IDs reviewed by LLM for distillation
- `embedded_ids.txt` - Case IDs with generated embeddings
- `faiss_version.json` - Current FAISS index version and metadata

## Purpose

These files enable the pipeline to:
1. Resume from any point after a crash
2. Avoid reprocessing already-handled items
3. Track progress across daily runs

## Important

- Never manually modify these files unless recovering from corruption
- Back up before any manual intervention
- Files are append-only during normal operation
